      <h2 style="margin-top:6px; color:#00c6ff;">A New Era of Exploration</h2>

      <p>
        Space has always captured our imagination. From the first lunar footprints to the breathtaking images returned by telescopes, every step forward reshapes how we see our place in the universe.
        Today we stand at the edge of a new space age ‚Äî one driven by smarter machines, reusable launch systems, and global collaboration. The coming decades will not simply be about visiting space; they will be about living, working and connecting through it.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#00c6ff;">Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial intelligence is becoming the backbone of modern missions. Where early spacecraft required constant human direction, modern probes and rovers use onboard intelligence to make real-time decisions.
        <strong>Autonomous robots</strong> will prepare landing sites, assemble habitats, and scout hazardous areas ‚Äî reducing risk and extending mission capability. On the data side, AI will sift through terabytes of sensor and telescope data, identifying targets and anomalies far faster than human teams could.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#00c6ff;">Reusable Rockets and Lower Costs</h3>
      <p>
        Reusability changed the economics of spaceflight. Recoverable boosters and reusable spacecraft are driving down launch costs, enabling more frequent missions and commercial activity.
        As reusability improves ‚Äî and as entire launch systems become turnover-capable ‚Äî the barriers to entry for research institutions, startups, and nations will fall, turning space into a platform for innovation similar to the internet.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#00c6ff;">Habitats, Life Support, and Human Expansion</h3>
      <p>
        Long-term habitation requires more than rockets ‚Äî it needs closed-loop life support, radiation protection, and modular habitat technology. Inflatable modules, regenerative life systems, and advanced shielding research are turning temporary outposts into potential long-duration bases.
        The Moon will serve as a testing ground; Mars remains the ambitious next step. Technologies validated in lunar orbit and on cis-lunar stations will be the foundation for any multi-planet efforts.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#00c6ff;">Satellite Networks & Terrestrial Impact</h3>
      <p>
        Satellite constellations are reshaping connectivity and Earth observation. Small, inexpensive satellites now provide broadband internet to remote communities, enable near-real-time environmental monitoring, and improve navigation and emergency response.
        As constellations scale, space becomes intertwined with daily life on Earth ‚Äî powering communications, climate science, logistics and more.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#00c6ff;">Collaboration and Policy</h3>
      <p>
        The technical challenges of space are entwined with political and social choices. The International Space Station demonstrated how cooperation amplifies progress; future ambitions will require shared standards, debris mitigation, and agreements on resource use.
        Coordinated international efforts help reduce duplication, lower cost, and increase safety ‚Äî making ambitious missions possible sooner.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color:#00c6ff;">What Comes Next</h3>
      <p>
        The future of space technology is not a single invention but a convergence ‚Äî AI-enabled systems, cheaper access to orbit, resilient habitats, and global cooperation. These trends point toward a future where space is less a destination and more an extension of human industry, science and daily life.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:18px;">
        <strong>Final thought:</strong> The next chapter of space exploration will be defined less by a single giant leap and more by constant, sustainable progress. As engineers, scientists and curious minds continue to push forward, our reach into the cosmos will become broader, deeper and profoundly more integrated with life on Earth.
